## Abstract
A minimum mean square error of 0.3769 was obtained on the test dataset with a Stacked Regressor model to predict the sale price of a house with the dataset.Stacked Regressor model helped to improve the performance of all its constituent models.


## Dataset
The housing dataset â€œHouse Prices". size of 1000 samples with 10 features were provided

## Feature Engineering
-
-checking the skewness and applied  logarithmic transformation was applied skewed features to the sale price for prediction.
 New columns were added to the data frame such as total bathrooms.
 
## Data Modelling
A total of seven different models were used for prediction.mean square error and mean absolute error were the primary metrics used for evaluating the models.
